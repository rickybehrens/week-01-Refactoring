# week-01-Refactoring

Our client is a marketing agency that has requested us to refactor their existing code to increase web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. **Refactoring** an existing code is to improve it without changing what it does while meeting a certain set of standards or implementing new technologies.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find the semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attibutes
WHEN I view the headinf attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the tittle element
THEN i find a concise, descriptive title
```

## What I Did

- Started by removing some of the "div" sections and adding a header, sections, aside and footers elements to the already existing code
- Cleaned out the CSS file
- Changed some of the font sizes to make them easier to read
- Fixed the link's ids on the header so that they actually would take you to the part of the page
- Matched the size of the "aside" element to the other boxes so that it would have a more simetrical look and therefore more appealing to the end user

## What did I Learn?

By doing the following changes, I learned about accesibility of a website and figre out that part of the sucess of said webaiste would be its appeal to the end user. Obviously there's room for improvement, but as my first assigment I feel very happy on how thisone came up.

The more I learn, the more I can come back and continuously improve this one.

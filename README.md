# week-01-Refactoring

Our client is a marketing agency that has requested us to refactor their existing code to increase web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. **Refactoring** an existing code is to improve it without changing what it does while meeting a certain set of standards or implementing new technologies.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find the semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attibutes
WHEN I view the headinf attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the tittle element
THEN i find a concise, descriptive title
```

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
